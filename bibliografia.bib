However, it will misuse the network bandwidth and links. One variant of the SDN controller, namely open network operating system (ONOS), provides an intent monitor and reroute (IMR) method that can optimize traffic management based on the description of an object in the ONOS application. This method can optimize the network bandwidth and links of SDN. The IMR can monitor the network and reconfigure the network to restore network connectivity by maximizing the use of each link when transmitting data. This study examines the impact of using IMR with a custom topology on ONOS to find the best scenario by performing traffic management on a data plane consisting of switches totaling 8-12 switches. The parameters measured in this study are bandwidth usage and quality of service (QoS). The results obtained in this study are IMR able to optimize the use of each link and maximize bandwidth usage in a network when distributing data and following TIPHON standards.},

abstract = {Network bandwidth is a scarce resource that network operators monitor to cope with future traffic demands and plan more transceiver and fibre deployments. The inclusion of Machine Learning permits the usage of traffic forecasting methods to predict future link usage. Typically, traffic analysis is performed offline due to the high computational load and difficulty of obtaining real-time data directly from the underlying network devices. To overcome these limitations, this paper presents and evaluates an architecture for SDN-controlled packetoptical transport networks to allow real-time traffic monitoring in the transport SDN controller. The presented SDN controller is based on a micro-service-based architecture, which facilitates the ease of deployment of the proposed solution. Four forecasting methods are proposed and evaluated against two topologies to select the most precise and the fastest among them.The algorithm random forest seems to be the most accurate forecasting future link usage with 79.98 % and 95.88 % accuracy and a reasonable fast speed when implemented it into two different topologies}

abstract = {Network attacks show a trend of increased attack intensity, enhanced diversity, and more concealed attack methods, which put forward higher requirements for the performance of network security equipment. Unlike the SDN (software defined network) switch with a fixed-function data plane, switches with programmable data planes can help users realize more network protocols. Programming Protocol-independent Packet Processors (P4) is proposed to define the operations of the data plane and to implement user’s applications, e.g., data center networks, security, or 5G. This paper provides a review of research papers on solving network security problems with P4-based programmable data plane. The work can be organized into two parts. In the first part, the programming language P4, P4 program, architectures, P4 compilers, P4 Runtime, and P4 target are introduced according to the workflow model. The advantages of P4-based programmable switching in solving network security are analyzed. In the second part, the existing network security research papers are divided into four parts according to the perspectives of passive defense, active defense, and combination of multiple technologies. The schemes in each category are compared, and the core ideas and limitations are clarified. In addition, a detailed comparison is made for the research on the performance of P4 targets. Finally, trends and challenges related to the P4-based programmable data plane are discussed.},

abstract = {Intent-Based Networks (IBNs), which are originally proposed to introduce Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks, can effectively solve the challenges of traditional networks in terms of efficiency, flexibility, and security. IBNs are mainly used to transform users’ business intent into network configuration, operation, and maintenance strategies, which are prominent for designing the AI-enabled 6G networks. In particular, in order to meet the massive, intelligent service demands and overcome the time-varying radio propagation, IBNs can continuously learn and adapt to the time-varying network environment based on the massive collected network data in real-time. From the aspects of both the core network and radio access network, this article comprehensively surveys the architectures and key techniques of IBNs for 6G. In particular, the demonstration platforms of IBNs, such as the Apstra Operating System, Forward Networks Verification Platform, and One Convergence Service Interaction Platform, are presented. Moreover, the industrial development of IBNs is elaborated, including the emerging new products and startups to solve the problems of open data platforms, automated network operations, and preemptive network fault diagnosis. Finally, several open issues and challenges are identified as well to spur future researches.}

abstract = {Although within SDN community, the notion of logically centralized network control is well understood and agreed upon, many different approaches exist on how one should deliver such a logically centralized view to multiple distributed controller instances. In this paper, we survey and investigate those approaches. We discovered that we can classify the methods into several design choices that are trending among SDN adopters. Each design choice may influence several SDN issues such as scalability, robustness, consistency, and privacy. Thus, we further analyze the pros and cons of each model regarding these matters. We concluded that each design begets some characteristics. One may excel in resolving one issue but perform poorly in another. We also presented the design choices to build distributed controller that is scalable, robust, consistent and secure.}

abstract = {Intent-driven networks are an essential stepping stone in the evolution of network and service management towards a truly autonomous paradigm. User centric intents provide an abstracted means of impacting the design, provisioning, deployment and assurance of network infrastructure and services with the help of service level agreements and minimum network capability exposure. The concept of Intent Based Networking (IBN) poses several challenges in terms of the contextual definition of intents, role of different stakeholders, and a generalized architecture. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the state-of-the-art in IBN including the intent description models, intent lifecycle management, significance of IBN and a generalized architectural framework along with challenges and prospects for IBN in future cellular networks. An analytical study is performed on the data collected from relevant studies primarily focusing on the inter-working of IBN with softwarized networking based on NFV/SDN infrastructures. Critical functions required in the IBN management and service model design are explored with different abstract modeling techniques and a converged architectural framework is proposed. The key findings include: (1) benefits and role of IBN in autonomous networking, (2) improvements needed to integrate intents as fundamental policies for service modeling and network management, (3) need for appropriate representation models for intents in domain agnostic abstract manner, and (4) need to include learning as a fundamental function in autonomous networks. These observations provide the basis for in-depth investigation and standardization efforts for IBN as a fundamental network management paradigm in beyond 5G cellular networks.}

abstract = {Network slicing is announced to be one of the key features for 5G infrastructures enabling network operators to provide network services with the flexibility and dynamicity necessary for the vertical services, while relying on Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-defined Networking (SDN). On the other hand, vertical industries are attracted by flexibility and customization offered by operators through network slicing, especially if slices come with in-built SDN capabilities to programmatically connect their application components and if they are relieved of dealing with detailed technicalities of the underlying (virtual) infrastructure. In this paper, we present an Intent-based deployment of a NFV orchestration stack that allows for the setup of Qos-aware and SDN-enabled network slices toward effective service chaining in the vertical domain. The main aim of the work is to simplify and automate the deployment of tenant-managed SDN-enabled network slices through a declarative approach while abstracting the underlying implementation details and unburdening verticals to deal with technology-specific low-level networking directives. In our approach, the intent-based framework we propose is based on an ETSI NFV MANO platform and is assessed through a set of experimental results demonstrating its feasibility and effectiveness.}
