# Bachelor's Thesis â€” Intent-Based Networking with the TeraFlowSDN Controller

This repository contains the final version of my Bachelor's thesis in Computer Science, titled:

**"Studio della gestione degli intenti nel controller SDN Teraflow"**

## Abstract

The thesis investigates how the concept of Intent-Based Networking (IBN) is implemented in the [TeraFlowSDN](https://labs.etsi.org/rep/tfs) controller and how it enables the integration of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) with traditional network architectures. A practical experimentation replicating and modifying the third TeraFlow Hackfest is carried out, testing the behavior of the controller in managing intents under network constraints (latency, packet loss, capacity).

Topics covered include:

- SDN and its architectural advantages over traditional networking;
- The IBN paradigm and its practical implementation;
- Example of others SDN controllers
- The role of TeraFlowSDN as a Network Operating System;
- Experimental setup using Mininet, P4, and Kubernetes;
- Results and discussion on service creation, policy violations, and automation.

##  Technologies & Tools

- TeraFlowSDN 3.0
- Mininet
- P4 
- Kubernetes (MicroK8s)
- Docker CE & Buildx
